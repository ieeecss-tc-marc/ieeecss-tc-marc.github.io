                    leveraged to optimize the new production ramp?

                    <b>Abstract</b>: As manufacturing environments become
                    increasingly complex with the growing demand for goods,
                    optimizing the ramp-up phase of new production lines is
                    critical to ensuring efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and
                    product quality. This talk explores how Digital Twin and
                    Virtual Commissioning technologies can be leveraged to
                    accelerate the ramp-up process for new production systems.
                    We will discuss how Digital Twins—virtual replicas of
                    physical assets and Virtual Commissioning provides a
                    pre-deployment simulation environment to validate system
                    design, optimize control systems, and ensure seamless
                    integration of automated components before going live. By
                    combining these two technologies, manufacturers can minimize
                    downtime during commissioning, reduce errors, and improve
                    collaboration between design, engineering, and operations
                    teams. Attendees will gain practical insights into
                    implementing these technologies to optimize the
                    commissioning process, enhance production throughput, and
                    improve overall system performance during the critical
                    ramp-up phase.

                held during the week of Oct 21-25, 2024. These talks were part
                of TC seminar series on Control Technologies and Solutions for

                    Step towards Carbon neutral World

                    <b>Abstract</b>: This talk presents a low-cost, open-source
                    automation platform for electric vehicles (EVs) using the
                    Robot Operating System (ROS). We explore two control
                    strategies for remote operation: one that manipulates
                    Controller Area Network (CAN) messages for acceleration
                    control and another that emulates the analog outputs of
                    vehicle pedals and steering sensors. The development
                    includes essential velocity and steering controllers and an
                    advanced path-following algorithm for efficient EV
                    platooning. We demonstrate the platform's effectiveness and
                    potential to facilitate a carbon-neutral transportation
                    system through experimental validations, highlighting its
                    practical implications for the future of EV automation.

                    Control via Extremum Seeking in Wind and Solar Systems
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Speaker</b>: Sameh Eisa (University of Cincinnati)</p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Abstract</b>: In this presentation, we discuss briefly
                    the powerful theory of extremum seeking systems. The
                    near-unique Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) systems are known
                    to have the ability to steer a given dynamical system to the
                    extremum (maximum/minimum) of an objective function that is
                    unknown – expression-wise in model-free, real-time fasion.
                    Hence, ESC has been used in controlling solar and wind farms
                    to achieve the desired optimization output without knowing
                    expressions for many external parameters/profiles, such as
                    but not limited to the aerodynamic/wind effects. However, a
                    major challenge in applying ESCs is that they possess
                    persistent oscillations. In this presentation, we also show
                    our recent results in the Modeling, Dynamics and Control
                    (MDCL) lab, which provides a method to improve ESC
                    performance and attenuate its oscillations.
